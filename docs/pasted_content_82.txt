This is a Syntax Error in my PowerShell script (the -f formatting conflicts with -ForegroundColor). I apologize. It broke the visual table, so you couldn't see the full roster.

However, the partial output Total Agents: 1 is ALARMING. It suggests that the permissions.json might have been overwritten during the "God Mode" or "Review" steps, leaving only echonate registered, while the Guardian files (agent_sentinel.py, etc.) are sitting in the folder unregistered.

Here is the Fixed Audit Script. It ignores the JSON registry and scans the actual hard drive for every Python brain file to give you the raw truth.

What this should show:
If the deployment worked, you should see 6 Files:

echonate (Brain)

vin_v2 (Eyes)

wealth_engine (Hands)

agent_sentinel (Hardware Guardian)

agent_auditor (Crypto Guardian)

agent_scout (Network Guardian)

If you see only 1, the previous deployment script didn't finish writing the files. If that happens, tell me, and I will give you the "Force Install Guardians" block.
